# Infra

Abstractions and stubs:
- `llm.py`: LLM gateway interface and echo stub.
- `vector_store.py`: schema vector search contract and stub schema.
- `db.py`: DB introspection contract with safe probe stub.
- `storage.py`: context persistence helper.

Replace stubs with real services when wiring to your environment.
